                    <p><b>Prefatory Note – Statement of Objects and Reasons.</b> – Article 39 of
                        Constitution envisages that the State shall direct its policy, among other
                        things, towards securing that there is equal pay for equal work for both men
                        and women. To give effect to this constitutional provision, the President
                        promulgated on the 26th. September, 1975, the Equal Remuneration Ordinance,
                        1975 so that the provisions of Article 39 of the Constitution may be
                        implemented in the year which is being celebrated as the International
                        Women’s Year. The Ordinance provides for payment of equal remuneration to
                        men and women workers for the same work or work of similar nature and for
                        the prevention of discrimination on grounds of sex.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Ordinance also ensures that there will be no discrimination against
                        recruitment of women and provides for the setting up of Advisory committees
                        to promote employment opportunities for women. </p>
                    <p>(3) The Bill seeks to replace the Ordinance. <noteRef href="#repl-ordinance" marker="1" placement="bottom"/></p>

                        <p> If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act,
                            the Central Government may, by notification, make any order, not
                            inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, which appears to it to be
                            necessary for the purpose of removing the difficulty: Provided that
                            every such order shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be laid
                            before each House of Parliament.</p>
